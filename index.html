								Hi <br>
								I am <span style="color:green">A</span>nisha
							</h1>
							<h2 class="heading">Software Developer / Quality Analyst</h2>
							<ul>
								<li>
									A motivated Quality Analyst with 4+ years of experience in software testing 
									and an additional 5+ years of software development experience in finance, insurance, education and retail industry
									Passionate to explore and learn predictive data analysis and web designing</li>
								</li>
								<li>
									Technical skills: JAVA, SQL, functional testing
								</li>
								<li>
									Transferable skills: </li>
									<ul>
										<li>Communication: I was the only member from the project team selected to provide onsite training and first line support for Insurance brokers
													I was also promoted as a Business Analyst in Marine Insurance Business team to bridge the gap between technical team and Business users
										</li>
										<li>
											Diversity/adaptability: I have worked in various regions across the world in different industries. Most of the technologies used by the companies were new to me but I have quickly learnt and adapted with the changes
										</li>
										<li>
											Team managament: I have worked as a QA lead and have mentored new resources. I have also co-ordinated defect review meetings with offshore development team and onsite Business team
										</li>
										<li>
											Attention to detail: My inquisitiveness to understand how each component works in a project had helped me to identify a critical flaw in user migration prior to product roll out. 
										</li>
									</ul>
								<li>
									Why return to tech: I took a career break to take care of my little one. 
									I have always been passionate about working 
									in a corporate setting and would love to set my foot back.
									I had moved out from software development to testing in 2012. 
									I was taking online training courses to upskill myself during my career break. 
									but I understand that Tech Returners training programme provides career guidance 
									and an opportunity to work in a techforgood project, which will help me get back into a development role.
